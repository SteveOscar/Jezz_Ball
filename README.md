## Project Specs

For this project we were asked to build a fully playable client side game using exclusively JavaScript and a collection of approved libraries.

Emphasis was put on using design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code, separating business-logic code from view-related code, and using test-driven design.

## Challenges

This was the first project in JavaScript where we were writing code entirely in one language. It was challenging to adjust to writing tests for dynamic javascript methods after primarily focusing on Ruby and Rails.

This was also our first experience writing and troubleshooting collision detection. By the end of the project we developed a more astute understanding of how code can manipulate and pinpoint the behavior of elements on the DOM.

Additional challenges came from working with the velocity of an element in relation to its size and how that affected its interaction with surrounding elements.
