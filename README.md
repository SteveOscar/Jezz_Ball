## Project Specs

For this project we built a fully playable client side game using exclusively JavaScript and a collection of approved libraries. The game is rendered in HTML Canvas.

Emphasis was put on using design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code, separating business-logic code from view-related code, and using test-driven design.
